# CropLister

CropLister is a "Virtual Farmer's Market" that allows users to sell and purchase their own home-grown and home-made foods, such as fruit and vegetables, baked goods, and jams. Users are able to create an account to post their goods, edit/delete their posts, edit their personal user profile, view other user's products along with price and contact information, sort posts by category, and search for individual posts by keyword.

This group project implements the MVC design pattern by utilizing Java Beans and Data Access Objects, Servlets, JDBC with MySQL, JSPs with Java Expression Language and the JSTL, password encryption through BCrypt, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
